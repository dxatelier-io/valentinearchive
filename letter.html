    <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, My Favorite Girl 💌</h1>

    <div class="letter">
      This is the first Valentine’s Day i get to spend with you,
      and i never knew how to celebrate it properly…
      because every single day with you already feels like Valentine’s Day.
      <br><br>
      It’s crazy to think that this is our 5th month of knowing each other.
      Time moves so incredibly fast when i’m with you
      and i love every second of it.
      <br><br>
      We’ve gone through so many things together in these months.
      The happy days, the sad days, and everything in between.
      And somehow, we still choose each other until today.
      For that, i'm deeply grateful.
      Thank you for staying and for holding on.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for coming into my life.
      Thank you for being there for me in your own beautiful way,
      the way that always makes my days feel warmer and brighter.
      Thank you for becoming the safest place i can come home to.
      <br><br>
      On our first Valentine’s Day, i may not be able to take you
      to a romantic dinner or give you flowers like others do.
      But i want you to know that you are loved
      in the most sincere way i know how.
      Imperfect, but real. Simple, but wholehearted.
      <br><br>
      Happy Valentine’s Day, bby!!!
      I hope this year and the years after,
      we will still have many stories to celebrate together.
